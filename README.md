# NoSQLdb
**Background:** This is an assignment for my CS1660 Cloud Computing class. The python script creates a NoSQL database to store experimental data using AWS.

**Setup:** To be able to run the script locally on your computer: 

  (1) Use your AWS account and insert your access key and secret access key in the script as specified. 
  
  (2) Download the following experimental data in the repo (master experimental .csv file is also avaliable). Though do note, the experimental data is publicly accessible through these links:
  
    a.) https://datacontui.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/exp1.csv
    b.) https://datacontui.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/exp2.csv
    c.) https://datacontui.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/exp3.csv
    d.) https://datacontui.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/exp4.csv
    e.) https://datacontui.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/exp5.csv
